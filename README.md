# Phonon_relaxation
Based off work by PHYSICAL REVIEW B 90, 235315 (2014) DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.90.235315

Using same parameters in the above paper, I reproduced the phonon-induced relaxation plot (Fig 4). Using main.cpp, I produced the data in the relaxation.txt file and plotted that with the Mathematica file relaxation.nb
